# Get started

RNA is a collection of plugins and tools for web bundlers and dev servers, such as [vite](https://vite.dev/) and [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/). We distribute these plugins as open-source NPM packages, so they can be easily integrated into any JavaScript or TypeScript project.

While the project focuses on supporting the development of Web Components, many of the plugins and tools provided are also useful for more general web projects, encouraging the adoption of modern web features and improving the development workflow.
