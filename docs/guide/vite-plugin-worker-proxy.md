# vite-plugin-worker-proxy

Workers have a cross-origin policy that prevents them from being imported from a different origin. This plugin allows to import workers from a different origin by proxying the worker script with a `Blob` url.

Generally, this plugin is useful only in development mode, since in production the worker script should be served from the same origin.

## Install

npm i -D @chialab/vite-plugin-worker-proxy

import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import workerProxy from '@chialab/vite-plugin-worker-proxy';

export default defineConfig(({ command }) => ({
    plugins: [
        command === 'serve' ? workerProxy() : null,
    ],
}));
```

## Options
